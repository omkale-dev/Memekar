#### Description: 
- App Features:
	1. User can get current worldwide news.
	2. News for specific categories like `Business`,`Science` etc can be seen.
	3. One can also search for specific news
	4. News can be shared with others.
- This was made with the intension to learn to make http requests to the `api's` and display data accordingly . 
- I made use of `newsapi.org` to fetch the news data.
- The json looks something like this.
```dart
Article article = Article(
            title: element['title'],
            author: element['author'],
            description: element['description'],
            urlToImage: element['urlToImage'],
            publshedAt: DateTime.parse(element['publishedAt']),
            content: element["content"],
            articleUrl: element["url"],
          );
```
- Made use of `Listviews`,`Gesture Detector`,`Web View`,and `Custom widgets`.
- App follows `Material Design` throught.
- Made use of `MVC` pattern.
