#### Description: 
- App Features:
	1. User can select images from `local storage`
	2. One can add `text` on the selected image
	3. The text can be resized
	4. You can `change the color` of text.
	5. Also one can `add emojis `to spice up the meme.
- Being a meme lover, I had lot of fun coding the project. 
- I Made use of `Repaint Boundary`,`Permission Handler`,`Routing`,`Bottom Sheet`,`Dialogs`, `Listviews`,`Gesture Detector` and `Custom widgets`.
- Also created a custom widget which is draggable on canvas to allow user to place text and emojis accordingly.
- App follows `Material Design` throught.
- Made use of `MVC` pattern.
